# Express Note Taker
This app required me to create an express server that stores, displays, and deletes notes that have been supplied by the user via an HTML interface. 

## App Breakdown
This program is a note taking app written in HTML and JavaScript utilizing an Express server to update and save notes on the fly. Everything is run on the express server, which is responsible for serving all HTML pages as well as handling all requests from the user. This application has been deployed to Heroku for demonstration purposes.
